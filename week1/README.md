### Truth or Dare ML

The project is created to argue about deep-rooted gender discrimination in every corner of our society. Even our `Truth or Dare Machine` would differentiate questions depending on participant's gender like [Amazon has done within employment process by using their AI hiring tool](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK08G).
Again, `Truth or Dare Machine` has machine bias that is learnt from its creator, HUMAN. Unlike the real world, however, it will ask just only sensual question if you are a man. Yes. It is a twist for enlightening the public awareness.

_HOW IT WORKS_

The machine classifies the gender of participants using its eye(camera). According to the classification result, it decides what kind of questions and dares fit to the game player. All the Truths and Dares came from a real database on the internet, so it reflects real ideas of real people. Gender classification model used for the project is created by [Tupleblog](https://github.com/tupleblog/face-classification-js).
