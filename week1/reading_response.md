### Some thoughts after watching TED talk Gaming for Understanding

Game has became as an empowered medium beyond just as entertaining medium, In modern society, especially in the period of digital media. It has a great ability at storytelling, and it can make certain emotional reactions as same as the others: literature, music, movie, arts.

People share their own experiences and feeling about games that are played and shown with other quiet naturally, and they can easily find mutual empathy. Now, games are seem as the medium that likelihood of the enlightenment as some movies have done in the past in our society. Those can show specific ideas and stories us to emphasize the underlying message.

For instance, the game '[We Become What We Behold](https://youtu.be/9DChl7GR-ow)' throws a strong caveat that the mass media manipulate our perspective by concealment and distortion through actual gameplay. Another popular game '[Papers, Please](https://youtu.be/z1c0w5cYm18)' points out widespreaded prejudice and discrimination of our society.

Furthermore, these subjects of public awareness expanded their uses to other mediums. From that spontaneous one source multi-using, sort of social movement that pick out defects of our society could be arouse simultaneously and frequently.

I assume games, especially video games, are the most effective and most related medium to us, and more to the next generations since it grows exponentially along with technology. As a final thought about this consideration, I think now is apt time to re-think the ethical aspect and potential expectation of our games.
