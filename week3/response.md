While I was considering about the the empathy in terms of virtual reality technology, I was reminded of was a project from Agata Mergler. The artist’s project is the video portrait of the vocalist of She Wears Black and her sister was created with a prototype consisting of four cameras attached to hands of a filming person. 
The idea behind this project lies in catching the touchable, tangible with the eye of the camera, which is achieved by position of cameras. The second important thing for this project was random visual output, which resembles the experience of fragmentary perception of objects and people and the way we come into physical more intimate contact with them. The intimate character of this way of filming, when cameras are positioned on the hands to imitate touch instead of vision. What I expected to achieve from glancing the project was the feeling of empathy of camera’s gaze and not invasion. I believe the effect is a raw but very true and intimate portrait of the vocalist at work. The vocalist sings with all her body and her emotions, which she expresses in gestures and looks, this created an intriguing whole with the audio.
