I would agree with Stelarc’s thoughts:
“I think our philosophies are fundamentally bounded by our physiology; our peculiar kind of aesthetic orientation in the world; our peculiar five sensory modes of processing the world; and our particular kinds of technology that enhance these perceptions.”

I have nine tattoos on arms and shoulder. Those are easily exposed and perceived by other people. My tattoos, as a reflection of me, expanded the perception and even enhanced the ability of the physical sensory. Now I know the feelings from the sharp needle that getting through my skin. Now I have empathy for another realm that could be shared only between who has similar experiences. Although tattooing does not need a state of the art technology, it still has a ability to manipulate our body and perspectives. This kind of body manipulation easily down the anticipation, hypothesis, bias that veils the reality and restrains our perception expanding. For instance, in Northeast Asia, one of the cultural virtue is cherishing own body that is given by parents. By deep-rooted Confucianism, self expression and diversity unnecessarily have been discouraged. As a result, people think, live, express themselves in a similar way. However, in this kind of uniformed environment, attention-drawing appearance, like tattoo, can change one’s life profoundly. Although I can not describe all the anecdotes on this response, I have met various people, made great connections, experienced all the novel thing that I had couldn’t  imagine before taking tattoos on my body. Indeed, this personal challenge which breaks the barrier between the internal world of mine and outer world.
