Self reflection of comfort<br/><br/>
Choosing ‘should’ or ‘must’ is one thing that I could trust myself and set the starting point for living as true me. In the world of exponential growth, I was doing what I ‘should’ be doing. Everyone telling me what to do and where to work, everyone telling me that I should be better at this or that. All of this came to a point where something bigger was calling me, and that something was what I ‘must’ be doing. I would admit that before I started pursuing what I ‘must’ be doing, I felt that I was lacking a sense of purpose in my life and work. I abandoned the path well traveled and began experiencing as much as I can do without prejudice, that was only way I knew how to answer what I ‘must’ be doing.￼ Now I know how important it was for me to listen to that calling me got from within myself. I gained a new sense of self-awarness that allowed me to actualize a greater version of myself.
