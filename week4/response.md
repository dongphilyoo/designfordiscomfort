After few readings, I was reminded about a perpetual issue we have, as Korean, between Japanese. I just wanted to mention about it within this response.
Japan’s war crime flag is a symbol of the war of Japanese imperialist aggression in East Asian countries. It is the reason why many Korean claim that certain type of flag should be prohibited for life. In Japan, however, there is little controversy over the flag, and there is generally no interest in overseas. It is comparable to the Nazi symbol, the Hakenkreuz, which is taboo around the world.
In Korea, there is no difference between the two, and of course, both are provocative taboo. In terms of the Japanese flag, it has often been seen as a symbol of the Japanese military in the Pacific War and recognized as an imperialist flag. It is not a nation but a flag representing the military. Actually, there are new initiatives that prohibit using any kind of similar design to the flag. But the problem is that only a few know about the origin of the flag in history. And also the aggressive prohibition without utter explanation or gained public awareness is not able to be adapted into world society. The flag design is already used in our daily life without alarming. I think the reckless prohibition wouldn’t be the best solution, but constant claim is important along with pointing out the fact that the flag is the symbol of the Japanese fascism. And It is a certain problem that Japanese Army and Navy still using this kind of flag which is inherited the war crime flag.
