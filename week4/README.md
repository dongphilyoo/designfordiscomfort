### Final Proposal
__AI created Public Service Advertising__</br></br>
__Description__</br></br>
Published words have power and authority. We generally agree with the purpose of public service Ads for the reason somebody put their effort and money to publish them. Drifting on flooding messages, we donâ€™t have time and attention to filter them critically.
However, do we do agree with their statements? What is the public good and how the public make the consensus on it? Even very basic concepts we accept, such as liberalism or humanism, are subtly framed politically by the zeitgeist. When we look over public Ads, especially those from other historical period or other countries with different ideologies, we sometimes feel they are rather propagandas than public service Ads.
Our goal is to generate copies and images for public service Ads with AI and print them and post them in public places in New York. The data for AI are from various cultural and periodical public service Ads and propaganda, so convey feelings or weirdness and off-ness with inconsistency, for they are generated from all different background and purpose. With the juxtaposition of modern images and old phrases, or vice versa, we hope to raise awareness of social morality and zeitgeist that we are living in.</br></br>

__User Persona__</br></br>
Our user persona is a person who feels comfortable and loves to publish their messages through social media. They could have a didactic personality and be a bit nosy. They enjoy walking on the street for commuting in New York, and always gives attention whether some interesting stuff going on the street. They are also very familiar with taking photos and spread them through social media. They might be influencers, and always interpret messages in their own way. (also loves to share that idea with their followers.)
